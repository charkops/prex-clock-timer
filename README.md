This is a Real time clock-timer implemented on the Prex RTOS.
This is a project for class "Embedded and Real time systems" at the University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki - Greece
In order for this to run, we must configure Prex to run the source code as a single Real Time task (RT) at startup and nothing else. Instructions on how to compile up prex are at the end of this file.
